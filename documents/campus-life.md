## Student life at the Institute

A Students' Gymkhana Council co-ordinates student activities. Members
are elected by direct elections. Faculty advisors assist the Student
Body. Co-curricular activities are an integral part of a student's life
in IIITG. Our winter semesters are abuzz with sports and a cultural fest
-- Yuvaan. Students compete in both outdoor (Football, Cricket, Kabaddi,
Volleyball), indoor (Chess, Carom, Badminton, Table Tennis,
arm-wrestling, computer games) and cultural events (singing, dance,
play). Monsoon semesters are relatively quiet with students
concentrating on their studies. Students can explore urban life
surrounding the institute in Guwahati. Some of the pictures of our
student activities can be found

For instance, the Programming Club allows the students to explore their
computer programming skills in the field of computer science and IT to
develop a sense of professionalism. The Robotics Club gives a student to
conceptualize his idea and design state-of-the-art prototypes in the
field of robotics following the international standards. Certainly, the
student form concern clubs takes part in different competition on
national and international level regularly.

where techno-freaks come together and make nuts and bolts come to life.
The IIITG robotics club participates actively in inter-college
competitions, and have won prizes at different levels.

Programming Club: The programming club of IIITG is a very happening
space of continuously typing fingers and continuously coding brains.
These coders are a level apart, and they make sure to prove this
wherever they go - a proof that is beyond all reasonable doubt.

This is the space where all general knowledge whizz-kids come together
and get their genius minds to collaborate.

week-long extravaganza, wherein students put up an elaborate display of
their talents. During this fest, wide-ranging sports competitions are

badminton, etc. which inculcate in them a spirit to participate, compete
and win. IIIT Guwahati has its annual techno-cultural-sports fest named
"Yuvaan" to give equal opportunities to boys and girls to portray their
skills in various fields of recreation and sports. Also, we encourage
students to take part in various inter IIIT/institutes sports events, so
as to cater the need of performance outside the campus premises on which
our students perform at par with other institutes. IIIT Guwahati secured
overall second runner's up trophy in the recent inter IIIT sports meet
held at IIITDM Kancheepuram, 2016. Also, in the same meet, one of our
students emerged as a dark horse in carom bagging a Gold medal for IIITG
