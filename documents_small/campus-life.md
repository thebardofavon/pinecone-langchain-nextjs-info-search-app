concentrating on their studies. Students can explore urban life
surrounding the institute in Guwahati. Some of the pictures of our
student activities can be found

field of robotics following the international standards. Certainly, the

space of continuously typing fingers and continuously coding brains.
These coders are a level apart, and they make sure to prove this

This is the space where all general knowledge whizz-kids come together

badminton, etc. which inculcate in them a spirit to participate, compete

skills in various fields of recreation and sports. Also, we encourage
students to take part in various inter IIIT/institutes sports events, so
as to cater the need of performance outside the campus premises on which
our students perform at par with other institutes. IIIT Guwahati secured
