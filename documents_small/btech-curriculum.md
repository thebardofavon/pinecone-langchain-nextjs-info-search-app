#### Curriculum

First year courses are common for both CSE & ECE. This gives flexibility
to students for branch change after the first year. After the first year
common program, the second year program will be relatively fixed,
comprising mostly of core courses for the program. 3rd year onwards the
program will be more flexible comprising of electives, which may be
organized as streams. There is one HSS course every semester, for a
total of eight courses. Courses in Physics (2), Chemistry, and Biology
are taught from Semester III onwards.

#### Rules of change of Branch

::: list-view
-   The Institute permits a student admitted to change from one branch
    to another after the first two semesters. Such changes will be
    permitted, in accordance with the provisions laid down hereinafter.
-   Only those students will be considered eligible for change of
    branch/programme after the second semester, who have completed and
    passed all the common credits required in the first two semesters of
    their studies in their first attempt.
-   Change of branch/programme shall be made strictly in order of merit
    of the applicants. For this purpose the CPI obtained at the end of
    the second semester shall be considered. In case of a tie, the JEE
    rank of the applicants will be considered.
-   The applicants may be allowed a change in branch/programme, strictly
    in order of inter-se-merit, subject to the limitation that the
    strength of a branch should not fall below the existing strength by
    more than ten percent and should not go above the sanctioned
    strength by more than ten percent.
-   All changes of branch/programme made in accordance with the above
    rules will be effective from the third semester of the applicants
    concerned. No change of branch/programme shall be permitted after
    this.
:::

With a batch size of 130 in CSE, it can grow to at most 143 students and
it must be at least 117 if all seats are filled. With a batch size of 70
in ECE, it can grow to at most 77 students and it must be at least 63 if
all seats are filled. So, if only requests for branch change are from
ECE to CSE, then at most 7 ECE students will get a branch change.
